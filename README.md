## Description<!--@schambig-->

Git is a distributed version control system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

This project is aimed to explore the functionalities of `Git` working in a local repository through the CLI and pushing the changes to the remote repository.

After this project I was able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/):

* What is source code management
* What is Git
* What is GitHub
* What is the difference between Git and GitHub
* How to create a repository
* What is a README
* How to write good READMEs
* How to commit
* How to write helpful commit messages
* How to push code
* How to pull updates
* How to create a branch
* How to merge branches
* How to work as collaborators on a project
* Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo

* [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

## Additional Info<!--@schambig-->

Install `git`

* If `git` is not already installed on your terminal:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Basic usage

* At the end of this project you should be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

```
$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```
